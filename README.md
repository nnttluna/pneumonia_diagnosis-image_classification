# Pneumonia-Detection-from-X-Rays

# Creating ML algorithm for Pneumonia Detection 

We will develop a computer vision model to detect pneumonia in histopathological images, assisting diagnosis. Two classes will be used in this project: **Benign and Malignant.**

# Instructions

The project is broken down into multiple steps:

    Load and preprocess the image dataset
    Train the image classifier on your dataset
    Use the trained classifier to predict image content

Everything you need to recreate this project is on the jupyter notebook. Everything was coded in Google Colab, because of its GPU. The dataset was uploaded to Google Drive, so you can download it directly (the code to download it is in the notebook). For more details, the notebook includes the instructions to follow.

If you want to load the trained model, the code to download it, is in the notebook, in the "Load the checkpoint" section. The model was also uploaded to Google drive, so you can download it.

This project is updated to be compatible with PyTorch 0.4.0
